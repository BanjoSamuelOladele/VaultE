# Avalanche Subnet: DeFi

Welcome to the Modular DeFi Kingdom project on Avalanche! In this approach,i  explored building a decentralized finance with a modular design on the Avalanche Subnet. This modular approach allows for flexibility, scalability, and easy expansion of features.

## Overview of Steps

### 1. Set Up Avalanche Subnet

Initiate the creation and deployment of a specialized Avalanche Subnet, emphasizing modularity for the DeFi Kingdom:

- Follow the official [Avalanche Documentation](https://docs.avax.network) for setting up an Avalanche Subnet with a focus on modular design.

### 2. Define Native Currency

Configure your native currency within the ERC20 Token Contract to serve as the in-game currency for your Modular DeFi Kingdom.

### 3. Connect to Metamask

Ensure seamless interaction with your Avalanche Subnet by connecting it to Metamask. Navigate through the [Metamask Documentation](https://docs.metamask.io) for guidance.

### 4. Deploy Modular Components

Utilize Solidity and Remix to deploy modular components, such as ERC20 and Vault contracts, liquidity pools, and governance structures. This approach enables the incremental addition of features without disrupting the existing system.

### Smart Contracts

#### ERC20 Token Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

interface IERC20 {
    // ... (ERC20 standard functions)
}

contract ERC20 {
    // ... (ERC20 implementation)
}
```

#### Vault Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

interface IERC20 {
    // ... (ERC20 standard functions)
}

contract Vault {
    // ... (Vault implementation)
}
```

### 5. Modular Governance

Implement a modular governance system, allowing for the integration of various decision-making processes and voting mechanisms within the DeFi Kingdom.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Set Up Avalanche Subnet:**
   - Refer to the official [Avalanche Documentation](https://docs.avax.network) to set up the Avalanche Subnet with a modular design.

3. **Define Native Currency:**
   - Customize the ERC20 Token Contract to define your native currency.

4. **Connect to Metamask:**
   - Ensure seamless interaction with your Avalanche Subnet by connecting it to Metamask. Follow the steps outlined in the [Metamask Documentation](https://docs.metamask.io).

5. **Deploy Modular Components:**
   - Utilize Solidity and Remix to deploy ERC20 Token, Vault contracts, and other modular components.

6. **Implement Modular Governance:**
   - Design and implement a modular governance system to accommodate various decision-making processes and enhancements.

7. **Interact with Contracts:**
   - Test and interact with various functionalities of the deployed smart contracts through Remix or other Ethereum-compatible interfaces.
